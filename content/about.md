## What

[Food Not Bombs](http://foodnotbombs.net/) is a decentralized movement
dedicated to sharing free vegan and vegetarian food.

While each Food Not Bombs group is independent, we all adhere to a set 
of common core principles:

* Promotion of veganism and vegetarianism
* Horizontal decision making using consensus
* Dedication to nonviolence
* Food is a right, not a privilege

Our group serves a weekly hot meal. The food we serve comes from 
donations from local restaurants and food cooked by our members.

## When

Every Sunday at 4:30pm

## Where

[Occidental Park](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/47.60029/-122.33328)
in Pioneer Square, near the Fire Fighters' Memorial.

We setup tables next to the memorial and sometimes put up a canopy if 
it's raining.

## Who

A ragtag group of fine individuals. If you agree with the principles above
we encourage you to [join us](/join/).
